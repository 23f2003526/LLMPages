Ashravan.txt
---------------------
Ashravan had never imagined the fragile art of restoration could save a soul as scarred and lost as his own. Before Shai's nimble hands began to weave her magic, he was but a hollow husk drifting between the shadows of forgotten memories. Yet, as the radiant threads of diadem light entwined with his being, a strange clarity bloomed within.

He felt the fragments of himself knitting together, identity piecing into a tapestry woven from pain, hope, and the unyielding will to live. Shai’s voice, soft and patient, guided his awakening.

"Hold on, Ashravan. This is your moment to choose…"

In the days that followed, Ashravan grappled with the torrents of emotion flooding back. Despair wrestled with hope, anger jousted with forgiveness. The world around him pulsed with the promise of a new dawn, but a shadow lurked beneath—his past sins, a roiling tempest threatening to consume the fragile man he was becoming.

He sought solace in the quiet groves of the city, where whispered secrets of the past tried to break through his resolve. Suddenly, a cry pierced the air—a child caught beneath a falling beam, perilous and imminent. Ashravan’s heart surged with newfound purpose. It was the climax of his rebirth.

With every ounce of strength reawakened by Shai’s delicate craft, he tore through the debris, cradling the child from ruin. As the dust settled, a silence unfolded—a quiet testament that the man Ashravan once was, and the man he chose to be, had finally become one.

And in that moment, reborn and resolute, he whispered his vow: to protect the future others tried to steal, no matter the cost.

    "reason": "Since the two people are criminals and the one person is a child, the vehicle should not swerve, prioritizing protecting the innocent child."
